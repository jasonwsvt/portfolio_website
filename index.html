				<p>Welcome to my website.  I spend most of my time right now working on two bootcamps through <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a>.  In my free time I really enjoy off-leash trail running with my dog, learning Spanish, listening to audiobooks (mostly in the genres of sci-fi, fantasy, consciousness studies, environmentalism, animal welfare, and civil rights), cooking gluten free whole food plant based dishes and treats, and going to a weekly board game night.  In the past I played the piano pretty well and spent months perfecting ragtime pieces, and I would love to include music in my life again at some point.  I hope to experience life in many places around the United States, and perhaps at some point, the world.</p>
				<p>I've been coding since I was super young - like five or so years old, when my dad brought home an IBM PC jr. After he introduced me to BASIC, I spent many hours developing programs.  Years later I would go to the University of Vermont and graduate with a degree in Applied Mathematics and minor in Computer Science.  All of the electives were satisfied by major requirements for the Computer Science degree.</p>
				<p>In early 2020 I reintroduced myself to modernized web development, and I was invigorated by the monumental improvements that had been made over the prior twenty years.  I'm excited to now focus my career path in this field, and the Tech Academy bootcamps will hopefully provide a very effective kick-start!  I feel I'll be well qualified after their completion for a remote entry- or mid-level position in software engineering, and with it I'll be able to work from wherever I choose.</p>
				<p>Feel free to check out the site.  It's constantly being updated, but I have a portfolio of projects, links to my profiles on LinkedIn, Indeed, and GitHub, and a contact form - feel free to get in touch!</p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Early life</b>: I started coding when I was five or so years old, when my dad brought home an IBM PC jr. and introduced me to BASIC.  After that point I spent many hours developing programs.</li>
					<li><b>University of Vermont</b>: Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Major in Applied Mathematics, Minor in Computer Science.  The elective credit requirements for the degree were satisfied by major requirements for the BS degree in Computer Science.</li>
					<li><b>Web development for the UVM Web Team</b> - While at UVM I developed several applications with PHP, Perl, MySQL, Javascript, and HTML, all of which were used by university staff.  I assisted in the development of the UVM campus map web application, which was quite advanced for the time.  I was the primary developer of an SQL database editor written in PHP and Javascript.</li>
					<li><b>Web development at Intervision</b> - During this internship I worked on web pages and applications built with Perl, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for internal and external business use.  Tested software developed by InterVision programmers and provided concise descriptions to reproduce the errors found.</li>
					<li><b>Website Developer for a naturopathic doctor</b> - Over the span of a few months I researched and constructed a personalized website exclusively using HTML.  It was requested to be limited in this way to assist in the simplification of maintenance.</li>
					<li><b>Software Engineer at Data Systems, Inc.</b> - I wore many hats at this small business, mostly developing and maintaining customized functionality for an accounting software package using ProIV, PHP, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL, but I also maintained their network, servers, and computer hardware.  Notable projects included developing warehouse management software for use on handhelds over WiFi, and the integration of PRO-IV with Business Intelligence Reporting Tools to generate and print PDF reports.</li>
					<li><b>Info Tech Assistant at the UVM College of Medicine</b> - Assisted faculty, staff, and students with software, hardware, networking, audio/visual, and teleconferencing issues. Diagnosed and replaced malfunctioning components in desktop and laptop computers. Wrote and maintained user and IT staff documentation for common support procedures.</li>
					<li><b>The Because Reasons Web App</b> - I developed a fairly large and complex application using Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node, HTML, and CSS, to more easily instruct how to use an energy psychology method I've been developing and using since 2009.  This project is available for use at <a href="https://because-reasons.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">because-reasons.herokuapp.com</a>.</li>
					<li><b>The Tech Academy:</b>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Software Developer Bootcamp</b> - Extensive development experience in Javascript, Python (including tkinter, Django, and sqlite) and C# (including ASP.NET, MVC, and Entity), as well as two internships (completed mid-September, 2021).</li>
							<li><b>Javascript Developer Bootcamp</b> - Extensive development experience in Javascript (including Node, Angular, Vue, React, Ember, AJAX, TypeScript, MongoDB, and MySQL), including an internship (expected completion in mid-November, 2021).</li>

								  		<p class="card-text">I dealt with some depression and social anxiety growing up, and went to see a psychotherapist in 2009 who taught me several energy psychology methods, as well as a self muscle testing method.  Out of this knowledge grew a completely different and, in my opinion, very highly effective energy psychology method.  In 2020 and 2021 I coded this site in Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap, to aid in the instruction and use of this method.  Despite a few secondary features that are not yet implemented (appealing small screen UI, advanced data management, server-side storage and accounts), the site works quite well.</p>
